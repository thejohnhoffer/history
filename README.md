Instead, use [use-hash-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-hash-history) ([View on Github](https://github.com/thejohnhoffer/use-hash-history#use-hash-history)).

```
yarn add use-hash-history
```

Whereas `history-noslash` is a fork of [history](https://github.com/remix-run/history/), [use-hash-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-hash-history) has `history` as a peer dependency. I designed `use-hash-history` to easily accomodate any non-breaking updates to `history@5`, and I plan to maintain that pacakge going forward.
